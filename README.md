# WeatherApp
    
## Description: 

Our task was to create a Weather Dashboard using the third-party API from OpenWeather. 

* HTML was created with an HTML file, as well as dynamically creating new HTML elements using JQuery within the Javascript file.
* The application allows the user to search cities for current and a 5 day weather forcast. The URL used for the Ajax call are saved to local storage of the user's device. The previously searched cities are also prepended to a display in the UI for the user to re-select.
